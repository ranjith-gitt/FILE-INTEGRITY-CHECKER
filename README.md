# DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED
Task Description: File Integrity Checker Development
The goal of this task was to develop a File Integrity Checker to monitor file changes in a directory using cryptographic hash values. The tool calculates hash values for each file and compares them to detect changes, missing files, or new files. The task involves three key components: calculating file hashes, creating a baseline of file hashes, and checking file integrity.

**1. File Hash Calculation**

The calculate_hash function computes the hash of a file using a specified hashing algorithm (default: sha256). It reads the file in binary mode and processes it in chunks to handle large files efficiently. The hashlib.new() method is used to initialize the hash function, ensuring compatibility with different algorithms.

**2. Creating the Baseline**

The create_baseline function creates an initial snapshot of a directory by calculating the hash values of all files in the directory and its subdirectories. The hashes are stored in a dictionary, which is then serialized into a JSON file. This file serves as a reference for later integrity checks.

**3. Checking File Integrity**

The check_integrity function compares the current state of files against the baseline. It recalculates the hashes for each file and compares them with the baseline. If a fileâ€™s hash differs, it indicates the file has changed. Missing files or new files are also reported.

**4. Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

The script offers a simple CLI that allows users to choose between creating a baseline or checking integrity. When creating a baseline, the user provides the directory and the output file for the baseline. When checking integrity, the user provides the baseline file for comparison.

**5. Error Handling and Optimization**

The script handles errors like missing files or permission issues without crashing. It also optimizes memory usage by processing files in chunks, making it efficient for larger directories and files.
